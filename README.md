### Notes for reviewer

I changed directories order for the project. In the src directory you can find source files for this project, and in dist folder you can find built version of project.

I used browserSync as web-server for this project so the port is changed to 3000. If you will run server on another port you need to change it in dbhelper.js files in src/js/main/ and src/js/page/ directories and then type gulp.
